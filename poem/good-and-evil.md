--- title: "Good and Evil" date: "2025-01-19" language: "en" author: Adam --- In all my life, I have never understood the dance-off between evil and good. A tug of war, a clash of choice— It’s been going on since the beginning of time. Thinking one is different from the other, Thinking they are opposites of each other. It’s true, but ask yourself this: Are they really against each other? Or are they both working toward something greater? As humanity stands, good and evil dance, Swaying up and down like a scale, Seeking equilibrium and balance. Take a glance: in this life, two forces, Like husband and wife— A cooperation, managing all of creation.
